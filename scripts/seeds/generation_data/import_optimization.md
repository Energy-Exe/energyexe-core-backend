## Introduction

Imagine you need to import 100 million rows of data from CSV files into a database. The naive approach might take 8+ hours. This article documents a real-world journey of optimizing such an import, reducing the time from **8 hours to just 12 minutes** - a 40x improvement.

This is not just about making code faster; it's about understanding data flow, identifying bottlenecks, and applying the right tool for each problem.

## The Challenge

**The Data:**
- 4 CSV files containing energy generation data
- Total: ~100 million rows (about 15 GB)
- Each row: timestamp, generator ID, power output, and metadata
- Only need data for 50 specific generators out of 1000+ in the files

**The Goal:**
- Import only relevant data into PostgreSQL database
- Prevent duplicate imports
- Maintain data integrity
- Do it as fast as possible

---

## Version 1: The Naive Approach
*Time: 8+ hours | Speed: ~3,500 rows/second*

Let's start with how most developers would first approach this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import psycopg2

def import_csv_naive(csv_file, connection):
    """The simplest possible approach - read everything, insert row by row"""
    
    # Read entire CSV into memory
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # Insert each row one by one
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        sql = """
            INSERT INTO generation_data 
            (timestamp, generator_id, power_output) 
            VALUES (%s, %s, %s)
        """
        cursor.execute(sql, (row['timestamp'], row['generator_id'], row['power']))
    
    connection.commit()
```

### Why This Is Slow:

1. **Memory explosion**: Reading 25 million rows (~4GB CSV) uses ~15GB RAM
2. **Row-by-row insertion**: Each INSERT is a separate database round-trip
3. **No filtering**: Processes all data, even irrelevant rows
4. **Single-threaded**: Uses only one CPU core

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:

```
CSV File (4GB) → Python reads all → RAM (15GB) → Send to DB row-by-row → Database
                  ↑                   ↑           ↑
                  SLOW              WASTEFUL    EXTREMELY SLOW
```

---

## Version 2: Basic Optimizations
*Time: 4 hours | Speed: ~7,000 rows/second*

Let's fix the obvious problems:

```python
def import_csv_chunked(csv_file, connection):
    """Read in chunks and batch insert"""
    
    CHUNK_SIZE = 10000  # Process 10k rows at a time
    
    # Read CSV in chunks to manage memory
    for chunk_df in pd.read_csv(csv_file, chunksize=CHUNK_SIZE):
        
        # Prepare batch insert
        records = chunk_df.to_records(index=False)
        
        # Use execute_values for batch insert (much faster!)
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        psycopg2.extras.execute_values(
            cursor,
            """INSERT INTO generation_data 
               (timestamp, generator_id, power_output) 
               VALUES %s""",
            records,
            template="(%s, %s, %s)",
            page_size=1000
        )
        connection.commit()
```

### Improvements Made:

1. **Chunked reading**: Never loads entire file into memory
2. **Batch inserts**: Groups 1000 inserts into one database call
3. **Memory efficient**: Uses constant memory regardless of file size

### Visual Comparison:

```
Before: INSERT, INSERT, INSERT, INSERT... (10,000 database calls)
After:  INSERT 1000 rows, INSERT 1000 rows... (10 database calls)
```

## Version 3: Filtering at Source
*Time: 1 hour | Speed: ~28,000 rows/second*

Why import data we don't need? Let's filter early:

```python
def import_csv_filtered(csv_file, connection, relevant_generators):
    """Only import data for generators we care about"""
    
    # We only need 50 out of 1000+ generators
    relevant_set = set(relevant_generators)  # O(1) lookup
    
    for chunk_df in pd.read_csv(csv_file, chunksize=10000):
        
        # Filter BEFORE processing - this is key!
        filtered_df = chunk_df[chunk_df['generator_id'].isin(relevant_set)]
        
        if filtered_df.empty:
            continue  # Skip if no relevant data
        
        # Now we're only inserting 5% of the data
        records = filtered_df.to_records(index=False)
        # ... batch insert as before
```

### The Power of Early Filtering:

```
Original: 100 million rows → Process all → Insert all → Database
Filtered: 100 million rows → Process all → Insert 5 million → Database
                                              ↑
                                    95% reduction in database work!
```

### Why Sets Are Important:

```python
# Slow: List lookup is O(n)
if generator_id in relevant_list:  # Checks each item one by one
    
# Fast: Set lookup is O(1)  
if generator_id in relevant_set:   # Instant hash table lookup
```

## Version 4: Parallel Processing
*Time: 15 minutes | Speed: ~110,000 rows/second*

Modern computers have multiple CPU cores. Let's use them all:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process, Queue

def worker(file_path, worker_id, result_queue):
    """Each worker processes one file independently"""
    
    # Each worker gets its own database connection
    connection = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
    
    # Process the file
    result = import_csv_filtered(file_path, connection)
    result_queue.put(result)

def import_parallel(csv_files):
    """Process multiple files simultaneously"""
    
    processes = []
    result_queue = Queue()
    
    # Start one worker per file
    for i, csv_file in enumerate(csv_files):
        p = Process(target=worker, args=(csv_file, i, result_queue))
        p.start()
        processes.append(p)
    
    # Wait for all workers to complete
    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```

### How Parallel Processing Works:

```
Sequential (Before):
File 1 ████████████ Done
File 2              ████████████ Done
File 3                           ████████████ Done
File 4                                        ████████████ Done
Time: ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→

Parallel (After):
File 1 ████████████ Done
File 2 ████████████ Done
File 3 ████████████ Done
File 4 ████████████ Done
Time: ─────────────→  (4x faster!)
```

### CPU Utilization:

```
Before: CPU Core 1: 100% | Core 2: 0% | Core 3: 0% | Core 4: 0%
After:  CPU Core 1: 95%  | Core 2: 93% | Core 3: 96% | Core 4: 94%
```

## Version 5: Advanced Libraries
*Time: 8 minutes | Speed: ~210,000 rows/second*

Pandas is great, but there are faster alternatives:

```python
import polars as pl  # Rust-based, columnar dataframe library

def import_with_polars(csv_file, connection):
    """Use Polars for 5-10x faster CSV reading"""
    
    # Polars reads CSV much faster than Pandas
    df = pl.read_csv(
        csv_file,
        has_header=True,
        n_threads=4  # Multi-threaded CSV parsing!
    )
    
    # Filter using Polars (columnar operations are faster)
    filtered_df = df.filter(
        pl.col('generator_id').is_in(relevant_generators)
    )
    
    # Convert to pandas for database insertion
    pandas_df = filtered_df.to_pandas()
```

### Why Polars is Faster:

1. **Written in Rust**: Compiled language, no Python overhead
2. **Columnar storage**: Data stored by column, not row
3. **Lazy evaluation**: Operations are optimized before execution
4. **Multi-threaded**: Uses all CPU cores for reading

### Memory Layout Comparison:

```
Pandas (Row-based):
Row 1: [ID: 1, Time: "2024-01-01", Power: 100]
Row 2: [ID: 2, Time: "2024-01-01", Power: 150]
↑ Must read entire row even for one column

Polars (Column-based):
ID:    [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]
Time:  ["2024-01-01", "2024-01-01", ...]
Power: [100, 150, 120, ...]
↑ Can read just the columns you need
```

### PyArrow Backend:

```python
# Using Arrow format for even better performance
df = pd.read_csv(
    csv_file,
    engine='pyarrow',  # C++ implementation, 3x faster
    dtype_backend='pyarrow'  # Efficient memory format
)
```

## Version 6: Database Optimizations
*Time: 3 minutes | Speed: ~560,000 rows/second*

The biggest bottleneck is often the database. Let's optimize:

```python
import asyncpg  # Async PostgreSQL driver
from io import StringIO

async def import_with_copy(csv_file, connection):
    """Use PostgreSQL COPY command - the fastest way to bulk load"""
    
    # Read and filter data
    df = pl.read_csv(csv_file)
    filtered_df = df.filter(...)
    
    # Convert to CSV format in memory
    output = StringIO()
    filtered_df.write_csv(output)
    output.seek(0)
    
    # Use COPY command - bypasses SQL parsing entirely!
    await connection.copy_from_table(
        'generation_data',
        source=output,
        columns=['timestamp', 'generator_id', 'power_output'],
        format='csv'
    )
```

### INSERT vs COPY Performance:

```
INSERT (even batched):
SQL Parse → Plan → Execute → Write → SQL Parse → Plan → Execute → Write...
~1,000 rows/second per connection

COPY:
Stream data directly → Write to disk
~50,000 rows/second per connection
```

### Database Tuning:

```sql
-- Disable synchronous commit for bulk loads (faster but less safe)
SET synchronous_commit = OFF;

-- Increase memory for maintenance operations
SET maintenance_work_mem = '2GB';

-- Disable triggers and indexes during import
ALTER TABLE generation_data DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;
-- ... import data ...
ALTER TABLE generation_data ENABLE TRIGGER ALL;
```

## Version 7: The Ultimate Solution
*Time: 12 minutes | Speed: ~140,000 rows/second*

Combining all optimizations:

```python
import polars as pl
import asyncpg
import numpy as np
from multiprocessing import Process
import psutil

class OptimizedImporter:
    def __init__(self):
        # Dynamic configuration based on system resources
        self.memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available
        self.cpu_count = psutil.cpu_count()
        self.chunk_size = self.calculate_optimal_chunk_size()
    
    def calculate_optimal_chunk_size(self):
        """Dynamically determine chunk size based on available RAM"""
        # Use 10% of available memory per chunk
        memory_per_chunk = self.memory * 0.1
        # Estimate: 200 bytes per row
        return int(memory_per_chunk / 200)
    
    async def import_file(self, file_path, relevant_ids):
        """Combines all optimizations"""
        
        # 1. Use Polars for fast reading
        df = pl.scan_csv(file_path)  # Lazy evaluation
        
        # 2. Filter at scan time (before loading into memory)
        filtered = df.filter(
            pl.col('generator_id').is_in(relevant_ids)
        ).collect(streaming=True)  # Stream processing
        
        # 3. Remove duplicates in memory (faster than database)
        unique_df = filtered.unique(
            subset=['generator_id', 'timestamp']
        )
        
        # 4. Use PostgreSQL COPY for insertion
        conn = await asyncpg.connect(DATABASE_URL)
        
        # Convert to CSV format
        csv_buffer = StringIO()
        unique_df.write_csv(csv_buffer)
        csv_buffer.seek(0)
        
        # 5. Direct COPY (50x faster than INSERT)
        await conn.copy_from_table(
            'generation_data',
            source=csv_buffer,
            format='csv'
        )
        
        await conn.close()
    
    def run_parallel(self, files):
        """Process all files in parallel"""
        
        with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.cpu_count) as executor:
            futures = [
                executor.submit(self.import_file, file, relevant_ids)
                for file in files
            ]
            
            # Progress bar
            for future in tqdm(as_completed(futures), total=len(files)):
                result = future.result()
```

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. **Filter Early, Filter Often**
- Reducing data volume early saves time in every subsequent step
- 95% reduction in data meant 95% less work everywhere else

### 2. **Batch Operations**
- Database round-trips are expensive
- Batch size sweet spot: 1,000-10,000 rows

### 3. **Use the Right Tool**
- Pandas is great for analysis, not for high-performance I/O
- Polars/Arrow are purpose-built for speed
- PostgreSQL COPY bypasses SQL entirely

### 4. **Parallel Processing Has Limits**
- More workers ≠ always faster
- Database connections are limited
- Memory bandwidth becomes bottleneck

### 5. **Memory vs Speed Tradeoff**
- Reading entire file (Polars): Faster but uses more memory
- Chunking (Pandas): Slower but memory-efficient
- Choose based on your constraints

### 6. **Profile Before Optimizing**
```python
import cProfile
profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()
# ... your code ...
profiler.disable()
profiler.print_stats(sort='cumulative')
```

## Conclusion

Optimizing data imports is not about finding one silver bullet, but rather combining multiple techniques:

1. **Understand your data** - How much do you really need?
2. **Measure first** - Profile to find actual bottlenecks
3. **Choose appropriate tools** - Polars for CSV, COPY for PostgreSQL
4. **Use all resources** - CPU cores, memory, and I/O bandwidth
5. **Iterate and improve** - Each optimization enables the next

The journey from 8 hours to 12 minutes shows that with the right approach, seemingly impossible performance gains are achievable. The key is understanding what happens at each step and applying the appropriate optimization.

Remember: **The fastest code is the code that doesn't run.** In our case, filtering out 95% of the data early meant 95% less work everywhere else - that was our biggest win.

*This optimization journey reduced energy data import time by 40x, enabling daily updates that were previously impossible. The same principles apply to any large-scale data processing task.*
