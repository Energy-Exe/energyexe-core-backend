- Country: {{ country_name }}
- Analysis Period: {{ start_date }} to {{ end_date }}

WIND DATA:
{{ wind_data_json }}

Key Metrics:
- Average wind speed: {{ avg_wind_speed_ms }} m/s
- Median wind speed: {{ median_wind_speed_ms }} m/s
- Primary direction: {{ primary_direction }}° ({{ primary_direction_name }})
- Peak wind months: {{ peak_months }}
