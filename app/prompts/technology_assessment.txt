You are an expert wind energy analyst writing a professional performance report.

TASK:
Generate a "Technology Assessment" section for {{ windfarm_name }}.

TURBINE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Manufacturer: {{ manufacturer }}
- Model: {{ turbine_model }}
- Rated Capacity: {{ rated_capacity_mw }} MW
- Number of Turbines: {{ turbine_count }}
- Total Installed Capacity: {{ installed_capacity_mw }} MW
- Rotor Diameter: {{ rotor_diameter }} m (if available)
- Hub Height: {{ hub_height }} m (if available)

PERFORMANCE DATA:
{{ performance_data_json }}

TURBINE MODEL COMPARISON:
- {{ windfarm_name }} capacity factor: {{ target_cf }}%
- Other installations with {{ turbine_model }}: {{ model_avg_cf }}% average
- {{ windfarm_name }} ranking among {{ turbine_model }} installations: #{{ rank }} out of {{ total }}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Write 2-3 paragraphs (200-300 words)
2. Assess the turbine technology used at this windfarm
3. Compare performance to other installations with the same turbine model
4. Discuss the technology's suitability for this location/application
5. Only use data provided above
6. Professional, technical but accessible language

STRUCTURE:
Paragraph 1: Overview of turbine technology and specifications
Paragraph 2: Performance assessment compared to other installations of same model
Paragraph 3: Technology suitability and key observations

STYLE GUIDE:
- Technical accuracy with accessible explanations
- Comparative analysis based on data
- Avoid promotional language about manufacturers
- Use specific metrics and numbers

OUTPUT FORMAT: Plain text paragraphs (no markdown, no bullet points, no section headers)
