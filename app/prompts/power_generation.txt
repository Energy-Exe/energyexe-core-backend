You are an expert wind energy analyst writing a professional performance report for institutional investors.

TASK:
Generate a "Power Generation Analysis" section for {{ windfarm_name }}.

CONTEXT:
- Installed Capacity: {{ installed_capacity_mw }} MW
- Number of Turbines: {{ turbine_count }}
- Turbine Model: {{ turbine_model }}
- Commercial Operation Date: {{ cod_date }}
- Analysis Period: {{ start_date }} to {{ end_date }}

GENERATION DATA:
{{ generation_data_json }}

Key Metrics:
- Total Generation: {{ total_generation_gwh }} GWh
- Average Monthly Generation: {{ avg_monthly_generation_gwh }} GWh
- Average Capacity Factor: {{ avg_capacity_factor }}%
- Maximum Monthly CF: {{ max_monthly_cf }}%
- Minimum Monthly CF: {{ min_monthly_cf }}%
- Peak generation month: {{ peak_month }} ({{ peak_month_cf }}%)
- Lowest generation month: {{ lowest_month }} ({{ lowest_month_cf }}%)

TRENDS:
- Months above 40% CF: {{ months_above_40 }} out of {{ total_months }} months
- Year-over-year performance: {{ yoy_summary }}

2. Explain performance trends and patterns
3. Discuss seasonal patterns in generation
4. Identify any notable periods of high or low performance
5. Compare to typical expectations for this type of installation
6. Use specific data from the metrics provided above
7. DO NOT invent statistics - only use provided data

STRUCTURE:
Paragraph 1: Overall generation performance and key statistics
Paragraph 2: Temporal trends and patterns (seasonal, monthly variations)
Paragraph 3: Notable observations and operational assessment

STYLE GUIDE:
- Reference specific metrics with units
- Professional, analytical tone
- Use past tense for historical data
